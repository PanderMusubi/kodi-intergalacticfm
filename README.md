============================

Installation
------------

Installation currently requires you to know where your `addons` folder is located. Please refer to
the [Kodi Wiki article on `userdata`](http://kodi.org/?title=Userdata) to find it. To find the
`addons` folder, simply replace every instance of `userdata` in the article with `addons`.

### Git

 1. Change into your `addons` folder
 2. Clone the repository into a new folder `plugin.audio.intergalacticfm`
 3. Done

On Linux and possibly Mac OSX

    cd ~/kodi/addons/
    git clone https://github.com/Oderik/kodi-intergalacticfm.git plugin.audio.intergalacticfm

### ZIP

Unfortunately, installing from a ZIP-file is not a lot easier

 1. [Download the ZIP Archive from GitHub](https://github.com/Oderik/kodi-intergalacticfm/archive/master.zip)
 2. Extract the contents
 3. Rename the resulting folder `kodi-intergalacticfm-master` to `plugin.audio.intergalacticfm`
 4. Move the folder to your `addons` folder

Again on Linux and possibly Mac OSX

    wget --content-disposition https://github.com/Oderik/kodi-intergalacticfm/archive/master.zip
    unzip kodi-intergalacticfm-master.zip 
    mv kodi-intergalacticfm-master/ plugin.audio.intergalacticfm
    mv plugin.audio.intergalacticfm/ ~/kodi/addons/
